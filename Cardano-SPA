Cardano SPA – About Us
Who Are the members?
Cardano Single Pool Alliance is a loosely connected group of separate stake pool operators who have all vowed to run a single stake pool for the sole purpose of providing the Cardano ecosystem with True Decentralization. Each member has unselfishly decided to forego the potential profit of running a stake pool in the hope of making Cardano one of the most resilient blockchain against any colluding or coordinated malicious attack from national governments, hackers, or the creator of the protocol. Each member strives to make his/her single pool profitable. However, when a respective stake pool reaches saturation, its stake pool’s operator channels help another SPA pool to reach saturation. An egalitarian decentralization of stake pools directly strengthens the resiliency of the Cardano network.  

Who We Are as A Group?
As a group, the Cardano Single Pool Alliance is camaraderie, not an organized entity, of single pool operators. CSPA has no central authority or leadership. As a group, we aspire to an ideal – that only an abundance of single-owner-single-pool can shield Cardano against any attack.  We are bonded together by a single focus – that each stake pool operator should operate a single stake pool in the Cardano ecosystem. 
We are not a corporation, a bureaucratic organization, a censorship entity, a Cardano policing agency, or a non-profit. Willing and caring SPO volunteers, instead of paid leaders, runs and operates The Cardano Single Pool Alliance. We have no leadership, board members, or CEO.  We are a group of SPO with mutual trust defined by our voluntarism to accomplish a goal. To achieve our goals and maintain some sense of structure, we do have a “Participation of the Willing.” If you are willing to tackle a task on behalf of the CSPA, you are part of the core volunteer structure.
